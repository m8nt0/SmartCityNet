# Design Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the design principles and architecture of SmartCityNet.

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture, with separate components for backend, frontend, data management, network simulation, and security.

### Backend

- Built with Django
- Provides REST API endpoints

### Frontend

- Built with React.js
- Provides a user interface for interacting with the system

### Data Management

- Uses Hadoop and Spark for data processing
- Uses MongoDB and Cassandra for data storage

### Network Simulation

- Uses ns-3 and OMNeT++ for simulating network scenarios

### Security

- Implements SSL/TLS for secure communication
- Uses firewalls and intrusion detection systems

## Components

### Device Management

- Handles IoT device data and status

### Network Management

- Manages network topology and status

### User Management

- Handles user authentication and roles

## Data Flow

1. Data from IoT devices is collected and sent to the backend.
2. The backend processes the data and stores it in the database.
3. The frontend retrieves data from the backend and displays it to the user.
4. Data processing jobs run periodically to analyze data and generate reports.
5. Network simulations are run to test different network configurations.
