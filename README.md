# SmartCityNet

SmartCityNet is a large-scale simulation of a smart city network infrastructure. The project aims to incorporate various subfields of network and communication to demonstrate a fully functional, interconnected smart city. The project will include IoT devices, mobile networks, network security measures, high-performance computing, optical networks, content delivery, and more.

## Key Features

### 1. IoT Device Integration
- Simulate various IoT devices (sensors, cameras, smart meters) across the city.
- Use protocols like MQTT and CoAP for IoT communication.

### 2. Wireless and Mobile Networks
- Implement 5G mobile networks for city-wide connectivity.
- Set up Wi-Fi hotspots and simulate user mobility.

### 3. Network Architecture
- Design a scalable network topology with routers, switches, and gateways.
- Use both wired (optical fibers) and wireless links.

### 4. Network Protocols
- Utilize TCP/IP for general communication.
- Implement HTTP/HTTPS for web-based services.

### 5. Network Security
- Include firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems.
- Use TLS/SSL for secure communications.

### 6. Distributed Systems
- Set up a cloud infrastructure for city data storage and processing.
- Use distributed databases and computing resources.

### 7. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Implement a CDN for efficient distribution of media content across the city.
- Use caching mechanisms to reduce latency.

### 8. Network Management
- Develop a network management system for monitoring and maintaining the network.
- Implement SNMP for device management and monitoring.

### 9. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and NFV
- Use SDN controllers to manage network traffic dynamically.
- Virtualize network functions to run on commodity hardware.

### 10. Vehicular Networks
- Simulate VANETs for communication between vehicles and traffic infrastructure.
- Implement safety and efficiency protocols for transportation.

### 11. Multimedia Networking
- Stream live video from city cameras.
- Ensure quality of service (QoS) for multimedia content.

### 12. Telecommunication Networks
- Integrate traditional telephony with VoIP services.
- Use fiber optics for high-speed broadband connections.

### 13. Simulation and Modeling
- Use network simulation tools like ns-3 to model network behavior.
- Analyze performance under different scenarios.

## Project Structure

### 1. Backend
- Python/Django or Node.js for server-side logic.
- Use cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) for distributed computing.

### 2. Frontend
- React.js or Angular for the web interface.
- Mobile app using Flutter or React Native.

### 3. Network Simulation
- ns-3 or OMNeT++ for simulating network components and traffic.

### 4. Security
- Implement OpenSSL for encryption.
- Use Snort for intrusion detection.

### 5. SDN/NFV
- Use OpenDaylight or ONOS for SDN.
- Deploy NFV with OpenStack or VMware.

### 6. Data Management
- Use MongoDB or Cassandra for distributed databases.
- Implement Hadoop/Spark for big data processing.
